<h2 align="center">The role of invariance in spectral complexity-based generalization bounds.</h2>

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
have been shown to be able to fit a random
labeling over data while still being able to
generalize well for normal labels. Describ-
ing CNN capacity through a posteriory mea-
sures of complexity has been recently pro-
posed to tackle this apparent paradox. These
complexity measures are usually validated by
showing that they correlate empirically with
GE; being empirically larger for networks
trained on random vs normal labels. Focus-
ing on the case of spectral complexity we in-
vestigate theoretically and empirically the in-
sensitivity of the complexity measure to in-
variances relevant to CNNs, and show several
limitations of spectral complexity that occur
as a result. For a specific formulation of spec-
tral complexity we show that it results in the
same upper bound complexity estimates for
convolutional and locally connected architec-
tures (which donâ€™t have the same favorable
invariance properties). This is contrary to
common intuition and empirical results.
